# my-note

my name is **moayad** , iam **25** years old 
I studied mechatronics engineering and graduated at 2019 

i always try to learn more and iam happy that iam learning programming at this time 

if u want to know more about me u can look at my github account

## good developer mindset

- Difficult to make even small changes

- Breaking functionality of the software by making changes

- Introducing a new bug by fixing another one

- Implementing code that is unnecessary

- Almost impossible to add a new feature because of complicated code

- The never-shipping product

- Throwing code away and rewriting it from scratch

To avoid being one of the victims, you should embrace the fundamental laws of software. You should develop a mindset that every developer should have. This mindset will help you make better decisions in your daily programming journey. You can keep your software as simple as possible. You can protect it from being an unmanageable and complex system.

**Here are the key points that every developer must master**

1. Conceiving The Purpose of Software
> Remember: the purpose of the software is not to show off how intelligent you are.

2. The Goals of Software Design

> To design systems that can be created and maintained as easily as possible by their developers, so that they can be — and continue to be — as helpful as possible.

**Every programmer is a designer**

3. (Mis)understanding
Developers who don’t fully understand their work tend to develop complex systems. It can become a vicious cycle: misunderstanding leads to complexity, which leads to further misunderstanding, and so on.

Actually, one of the best ways to improve your design skills is to be sure that you fully understand the systems and tools you are working with.

> Understanding is the key difference between a bad developer and a good developer

4. Simplicity
> Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. — Leonardo da Vinci

5. Complexity
> Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming. — Brian Kernighan

6. Maintenance
Maintenance is one of the most important things in software development. Unfortunately, developers usually ignore how important it is. Quick coding and fast shipping look more important than code maintenance. This is the point where they make a mistake — ignorance of future code maintenance.

> It is more important to reduce the effort of maintenance than it is to reduce the effort of implementation.

7. Solving Problems

8. Good enough is fine

**thats why**

- You will be writing code that isn’t needed
- You will increase complexity by adding unnecessary codes
- You will be too generic
- You will be missing deadlines
- You will be dealing with many bugs caused by the complexity

9. Self-Development
Keep learning. Try out different programming languages and tools, read books on software development. They will give you another perspective. Every day small improvements will make a real difference in your knowledge and skills.
